This problem was simple enough that I did not contemplate many options.

I considered adding paging, but I did not see that giving you much more information about me.

I considered adding unit tests, but again I did not see that adding value.

I did actually enjoy solving problems and writing code again as it has now been a few weeks.

I did add an extra repository method for getting filtered data.  I mainly did that to show parameterization, but also because it just felt right.

I do agree paging should be added.  That should include a paged data object with not only the data asked for but paging information like total pages and the page number returned.

I would want to see the use but making it async would probably be beneficial as well.
